It takes about 90 seconds. The code for this is used below. That is compared with 269 seconds to read it in using the JSON code that was provided. So in retrospect it was faster to read it in using the original code.\n",

The characters were being changed and the program was unable to contiue running with the unidentifiable characters. Reading everything in as UTF8 encoding fixed this issue. The conversion is very very slow, and takes several minutes to run on my machine. It was also found that an additional column was being added when converting between formats. This column could easily be dropped once the final data frame was created."
